The name of the game is "CORRECT THE WORD".
This is word game. To make this game we have use the language PYHTON. 
in this game the word will be given in by a random arrangment of letter we have to aarange them and have to make a perfect word.
if 1 word is correct then we will score 5 else we fail to arrange perfect word then we lossed a 1 from our score. 
for Hint  click 1 , and you can access the hint only once.
the main enjoyable thing is that , we will use a pyttsx3 module to speak a word which is corrected & to speak the Score.
This is basic idea of our game.
